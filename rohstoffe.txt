| The Niger Delta continues to be a challenging place to
  operate for many reasons. There is a fundamental lack of
  basic infrastructure in many areas, with poverty, lack of
  employment opportunities, widespread criminality and other
  factors all contributing to the social and economic crisis in
  the region.
